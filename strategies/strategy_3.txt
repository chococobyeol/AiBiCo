Low-Leverage, High-Win Rate Strategy
	•	Focused on compounding small daily gains (1-2%) for long-term growth.
	•	Used moderate leverage to minimize risk and ensure steady progress.
Capital Management Strategy
	•	Invested only 20-30% of available capital at a time.
	•	Started with higher leverage (up to 10x) with small capital, reducing leverage as capital grew.
	•	Discouraged over-leveraging or averaging down on losing positions unless carefully planned.
