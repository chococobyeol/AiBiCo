4. Low-Leverage, High-Win Rate Strategy

• Compounding with Small Gains: Wonyotti believed that success came from consistently making small gains rather than aiming for big, one-time wins. By aiming for small daily gains (around 1-2% per day), they utilized the power of compounding to grow their capital.
• Moderate Leverage: While Wonyotti did use leverage, they did so conservatively. High leverage carries high risks, so they preferred lower leverage to ensure stable, long-term growth.

5. Capital Management Strategy

• Controlled Investment: Wonyotti advised investing only 20-30% of available capital at any given time. Early on, they used higher leverage (up to 10x) when the capital was small. As their capital grew, they reduced leverage to manage risk.
• Disciplined Buying: They discouraged over-leveraging or "averaging down" on losing positions unless it was planned and well-thought-out. Beginners, in particular, were advised against averaging down on losses.
